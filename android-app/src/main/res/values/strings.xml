The main task of the application is to recognize the line number of a public transport vehicle.\n\nThe application consists of two main screens: the screen for selecting the type of vehicle you want to recognize and the screen for recognizing the line number of the vehicle.\n\nIn the vehicle selection screen, it is possible to choose one of the two available vehicle types. It can be a tram or a bus. After selecting the type, the user is taken to the line number recognition screen.\n\nThe line number recognition screen uses a camera to transmit the image to the analyzing engine. If the line number is recognized, this information will be presented at the bottom of the screen. The bottom part of the screen consists of two elements: the number of the recognized line and the level of probability that it is the line.</string>
